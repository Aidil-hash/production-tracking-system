Below is an outline for the project

Overview

This app will serve as a production line management tool designed to track materials, monitor output efficiency, and streamline communication across multiple roles. The key idea is to automate material tracking and provide dashboards tailored to each user type.

User Roles and Dashboards

Roles:

Operator: Responsible for scanning serial numbers to record each output.

Leader: Inputs the current model running and updates material counts manually.

Supervisor: Likely oversees operations, reviews performance dashboards, and monitors overall production efficiency.

Engineer: May handle troubleshooting, system analytics, and possibly oversee predictive maintenance or improvement processes.

Dashboards:
Multiple dashboards can be configured based on the role. For example, an operator’s dashboard might focus on real-time scanning and immediate output confirmation, while a supervisor’s dashboard shows aggregated performance data and material trends. An engineer’s dashboard could provide deeper analytics and alert logs.

Production Line Tracking

Material Count and Efficiency Calculation:
Every time an operator scans a serial number, it registers as one unit of output, and the app automatically subtracts from the available material count.
Efficiency is calculated based on the ratio of outputs over time, potentially factoring in planned versus actual output.

Material Prediction and Notification

Predictive Analytics:
Based on historical output data and current efficiency, the app can predict when material levels will drop below a threshold.
Automated notifications can be sent to the material supply team when the predicted level nears depletion, enabling proactive top-ups.

Suggestions for Improvement
Automated Data Collection:

IoT Integration: Consider integrating IoT sensors for real-time material tracking to complement or verify manual entries, reducing the chance of human error.

Historical Data Analysis: Provide trend reports and historical performance analysis to help supervisors and engineers identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies.

User Experience Enhancements:

Dashboard Customization: Allow each user role to customize their dashboard based on the metrics most relevant to their responsibilities.

Mobile Optimization: Since operators may be on the production floor, ensure that the app is optimized for mobile devices with quick scanning and data entry features.
System Integration and Security:

ERP/SCM Integration: Consider integrating with existing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) or Supply Chain Management (SCM) systems to synchronize data across your operations.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implement strict security protocols so that users see only the data relevant to their role, which is crucial in a multi-user environment.

Audit Trails: Maintain detailed logs of user actions (e.g., scans, material adjustments) to support quality control and troubleshooting.

Scalability and Maintenance:

Design the system to easily incorporate new roles or additional production lines without major overhauls.
Include an admin dashboard for managing users, roles, and system settings.
